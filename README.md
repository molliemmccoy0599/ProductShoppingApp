# ProductShoppingApp

My file was so large I had to just put a link after several attempts to minimize it.

## Overview
I chose to do th eapplication that I am also making for Chris's class similar to Brian, this was honestly really fun I think because it was something I was already kind of passionate about and that made this a bit easier. The whole process of creating the prototype from start to finish probably took about a week just with breaks but overall the prototyping portion was fairly easy as I had mapped out the sequence ahead of time just on a sheet of paper. I did run into a few things I wasnt completely expecting along the way but somthing that came to mind throughout this process was honestly "don't be lazy just do it" it might sound odd but it was kind of motivating to think; "ok you can do this, your just being a bit lazy" maybe lazy isn't the right word but I feel like I have the skills now to do more things. In terms of process and tools I used Figma, Premier Pro, and After Affects. I really like adding video elements so I found Premier to be helpful on that end as well as a few adobe resizing tools, but primarly used Figma, I really wanted to incoporate After Affects more than I did but was was please to incoporate it into the loading page with the wings. I did struggle to export that with a transparents background to overlay though so I was hoping to look deeper into solving such issues. 

## Users
The users of me shopping site are definitely more specific with 21+ being a major requirement throughout the application. Weed enthusiasts and overall just smokers, queer individuals, women, and people looking for a sperate space with other products are also looking towards this product. I really wanted to make to put in alot of safe guards when it came to the age so I looked into similar ID verificaion programs/ apps like Jumio to give me somewhat of a industry stard for similar features. 

## Learnings 
When it came to learnings, I honestly found that maybe I am not as bad at UX/UI in this capacity as I thought but rather I need to push msyelf thats hard wiht work and time constraints but I do think I show some promise and as I stated above I found myself learning multiple new things fromt his project and and just overall when we do similar projects. I do want to as I slightly stated and stated in class want to learn more about Affter Affects and really refine that skill.
